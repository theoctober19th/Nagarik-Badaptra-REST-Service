## About Nagarik Badapatra
The idea for Nagarik Badaptra comes from the difficulties faced by Nepalese people in governmental offices. The solution we proposed seeks forward to digitize the information about the location, working days, contact information etc. about the governmental offices as well as the नागरिक बड़ापत्र which contains the information about what activities and services are provided by the office, their procedures, the required documents, estimated time delay, estimated cost, whom to contact for information, whom to register complaint, and so on. We also propose that every government office provide their official notices via a digital notice board that our app contains.

The governmental offices that uses this technology will use the backend panel to create, update and delete the various information related to the office. Every office will have a unique office identifier, out of which a QR will be created and pasted in gates of the governmental offices.

The users who use the android application can search for the offices nearby their location, and also navigate to that place using the map. The users can view all the information of the office from any place around the world. Also, when a user is physically at the office location, he/she can scan the QR code provided by the office to access the information about that particular office instantly.

The project won Second Prize in the hackathon. It was conceived initially for this hackathon, and is not actively under development. You can contribute to the project if you want to take it further.
